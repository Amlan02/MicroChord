# MicroChord
A midi controller that aims to function like an omnichord

What you need:

- Sparkfun Pro Micro (clone) (Arduino Leonardo is a good alternative)
- MPR-121 capacitive touch module
- 12 button switches
- 12 2.2k resistors
- 1 100k resistor
- copper tape (or maybe come up with something else to get those electrodes going)
- wire

Update: June 13 2022:
Reddit User forshee9283 was very kind to come up with a small PCB Design that you can use instead of copper tape.
I put the RevA PCB files in this github but they are also on his github repo: https://github.com/forshee9283/Strum
I ordered 10 of these today and will post updates when the boards are here.
