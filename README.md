A midi controller that aims to function like an omnichord

What you need:

- MPR-121 capacitive touch module
- 12 button switches
- 12 2.2k resistors
- 1 100k resistor
- copper tape (or maybe come up with something else to get those electrodes going)

I will add more info to the README soon!
Stay tuned!
